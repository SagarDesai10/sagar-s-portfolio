  bio: "I'm a Full Stack Developer fluent in code, caffeine, and curiosity. From crafting backend logic in Spring Boot to dabbling in front-end sorcery with HTML and JavaScript, I build digital experiences with clean architecture and sharp logic. I’m all about elegant solutions and systems that just work. Code is my canvas, and production is my playground.",
  description: [
    "Writes Java like a poet writes verses – with structure and a sprinkle of flair.",
    "Thinks debugging is just digital detective work (and I'm Sherlock).",
    "Believes clean code is sexier than dark mode (well... almost).",
    "Dreams in APIs and sometimes wakes up optimizing SQL queries.",
    "Builds backends that behave and frontends that don’t fight back."
